		<h3> Fun fact: <br><br>
		 An octopus has three hearts and their blood is blue! </h3><br>
<p> While you are walking through the aquarium, there might be areas where the staff allows a session where you can touch and hold jelly fishes or sting rays! Do not worry, we only allow poisonous ones and ones that won't sting. <br> <br> There are also activities for children to attend to learn more about specific marine creatures. Additionally there are playgrounds and toys for children to entertain themselves while the parents have a break. <br> <br>There are also food and restaurants in case any one gets hungry. <br>
	  <br> <br> Many of our activities are supervused for the protection and safety of the people around them. 
		<br> <br>We provide many emergency kits and exit doors in case of emergencies. </p> <br> <br> <br> <br>
